        <i>How Children Succeed</i> introduces us to a new generation of researchers and educators who, for the first time, are using the tools of science to peel back the mysteries of character. Through their stories—and the stories of the children they are trying to help—Tough traces the links between childhood stress and life success. He uncovers the surprising ways in which parents do—and do not—prepare their children for adulthood. And he provides us with new insights into how to help children growing up in poverty.

            In their book, Unconditional Care: Relationship-Based, Behavioral Intervention with Vulnerable Children and Families, John Sprinson and Ken Berrick present the Seneca treatment model for working with clients with intensive needs.  Central to the model are the following three “streams” of assessment and intervention: relational, behavioral, and ecological.
          </p>
          <p>
            This treatment approach forms the foundation of all of Seneca’s programs along the wide continuum of care represented in the agency.  What follows here is a brief description of some key elements of the model and how they apply to our work.

            John Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst and leading contributor to the development of attachment theory, used the term “internal working model” to describe the framework through which children learn to see themselves and the world around them.
          </p>
          <p>  
            This model is developed through the actual interactions that children have in their early relationships with caregivers and other important adults.  These experiences shape their ideas about their own self-worth and capacities as well as their expectations of how they will be treated by others.  Once these beliefs are developed, they then direct the way that the children behave, which, in turn, impacts how others experience and react to them. The reactions induced in others often serve to confirm the children’s internal working models.

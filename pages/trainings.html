              In 2012, five new discretionary grant projects aimed at combining Family Finding and Family Involvement Strategies were funded by the Children’s Bureau.  This discussion group will examine the efforts of two of those projects in determining their needs, installing the desired practice components and braiding new and existing strategies into practice models.  Early results and fidelity measures will be shared with the audience and the implications of these results will be examined.  Facilitated discussion will follow, focusing on implementation strategies that promote family centered practice that establishes the importance of family involvement and participation in decisions affecting their family.

          <p>Seneca Orange County has a long history of providing fieldwork placements for graduate students working on their Master's in Social Work (MSW interns) and Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT trainees).  In addition, undergraduate students from the field of social work, social ecology, and health and human services are also considered for limited internship opportunities.  The Fieldwork Program at Seneca Orange County matches students with qualified supervising clinicians in programs of the students' interests.  In the Fieldwork Program, the fieldwork students gain first-hand experience providing direct, therapeutic care to children and families in the community, Seneca treatment clinics, and after school care.  All fieldwork students attend a one week basic training that serves as an orientation to the agency, the population we serve, plus the students receive a variety of topical trainings throughout the year.</p>
 
          <p>Graduate Fieldwork Placements follow a standard school year schedule beginning in the fall and ending in the spring/early summer.  First year students are required to work at least 16 hours per week and second year students are required to work at least 16 hours per week and second year students are required to work 20-24 hours per week.  Exact schedules are decided on with the supervising clinician according to the students’ availability and the program’s needs. Undergraduate Internships require a commitment of at least 10 hours a week with preferred length of internship to be 6 months or more.  Due to the sensitive needs of the kids and families we serve, we ask that students assist in providing a healthy transition into and out of our kids and families lives. Exact schedules are decided on with the supervising staff according to the students’ availability and the program’s needs.</p>

          <p>Employment opportunities are, and shall be open to all qualified applicants solely on the basis of their experience, aptitudes and abilities. It is the policy of Seneca Family of Agencies to grant equal employment opportunity to all applicants and employees without regard to race, color, national origin, marital status, disability, Vietnam Era Veteran status, age, religion, political affiliation, gender or sexual orientation. Seneca is committed to providing a fair, equitable, and inclusive work environment. We welcome candidates that will promote and value diversity and exercise teamwork and collaboration.</p>

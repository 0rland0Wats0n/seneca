          <p>Prospective adoptive parents begin the process by completing and submitting a form through these links: Bay Area Foster Care Form - Southern California Foster Care Form. The next step would be to attend an orientation near your area to learn about the different adoption programs offered at Seneca. A home study (family assessment), which includes documentation, criminal background checks, references, interviews, and parent education, typically takes three to six months depending on how quickly paperwork is received from the family. There is no specific income requirement, and it is not necessary to own your own home.</p>
          <p>Seneca Family of Agencies is particularly noted for its in-depth parent preparation, education and ongoing support. Parents are offered extensive informative resources to prepare them for the parenting journey, including skilled training by expert trainers, and a wide range of recommended learning materials.</p>
          <p>Seneca's professional staff have a high level of competence and many decades of experience preparing families for adoption, matching their wants and capabilities with the needs of children, and supporting families on their lifelong journeys. Seneca staff are responsible for the very high placement success rate and high client satisfaction ratings</p>
          <p>
            <span class="type__uppercase">INFANT ADOPTION:</span><br>
            For the placement of apparently healthy newborns, a prospective adoptive couple must have a stable marriage or relationship of at least two years duration and must reside in California. Single parent applicants are also eligible. Applicants are typically within their normal child rearing years, and profiles of potential adoptive parents are presented to possible birth parents who are receiving counseling through Seneca. Most birth parents request an initial face-to-face meeting and may wish negotiation of certain medical and other expenses as well as varying degrees of openness over time. Fees for Seneca&apos;s services will vary depending on the services provided.
